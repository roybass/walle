"2199":["This energy and force-absorbing fabric could represent a generational advancement in light body armor technology. What makes this remarkable fabric unique is that it contains microscopically thin layers of an advanced polymer containing nanites programmed for self-repair. In short, when a suit of body armor made form this material is impacted by any significant force, the nanites instantly begin to repair any damage done, which protects the wearer from further harm.

These effects typically last between three to five hours, after which the user can be expected to fall into a sound sleep, if taken prior to that user's normal sleep cycle. Furthermore, there have been no significant side effects reported from repeat and prolonged use, making Blue Paradise an extremely promising ârewardâ for slave laborers. Recreational use of Blue Paradise has not yet been reported, given the limited nature of its distribution only to select Amarr slave labor operations, and no evidence yet exists of addiction to this drug, if administered in a controlled environment.

Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.\r\n\r\nThe first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.\r\n \r\n<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>\r\nThough the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.\r\n\r\n<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>\r\nMany wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an \"incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.\"",103600000,468000,550,1,1,71250000,250,20068,468000,11536,null,{"types":{"3338":[{"bonus":15,"bonusText":{"de":"Bonus auf die StÃ¤rke von <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM-ZielstÃ¶rsender-Modulen</a>","en":"bonus to <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM Target Jammer</a> strength","fr":"de bonus Ã  la force des <a href=showinfo:3427>brouilleurs de cible CME</a>","ja":"<a href=showinfo:3427>ECMã¿ã¼ã²ããã¸ã£ãã¼</a>ã®å¼·åº¦ãå¢å ","ru":"ÑÐ²ÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°ÐµÑÑÑ Ð²ÑÑÐ¾Ð´Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð¼Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑÑ <a href=showinfo:3427>Ð¼Ð¾Ð´ÑÐ»ÐµÐ¹ Ð³Ð»ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ Ð·Ð°ÑÐ²Ð°ÑÐ° ÑÐµÐ»ÐµÐ¹</a>","zh":"<a href=\"showinfo:3427\">ECMç®æ å¹²æ°å¨</a>å¼ºåº¦å æ"},"importance":1,"unitID":105},{"bonus":25,"bonusText":{"de":"Bonus auf die optimale Reichweite und den PrÃ¤zisionsabfall von <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM-ZielstÃ¶rsender-Modulen</a>","en":"bonus to <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM Target Jammer</a> optimal range and falloff","fr":"de bonus Ã  la portÃ©e optimale et Ã  la distance de perte des <a href=showinfo:3427>brouilleurs de cible CME</a>","ja":"<a href=showinfo:3427>ECMã¿ã¼ã²ããã¸ã£ãã¼</a>ã®æé©å°ç¨è·é¢ã¨ç²¾åº¦ä½ä¸ç¯å²ãæ¡å¤§","ru":"ÑÐ¾ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ°ÐµÑÑÑ Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð¼Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¸ Ð´Ð¾Ð±Ð°Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑÑ Ð´ÐµÐ¹ÑÑÐ²Ð¸Ñ <a href=showinfo:3427>Ð¼Ð¾Ð´ÑÐ»ÐµÐ¹ Ð³Ð»ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ Ð·Ð°ÑÐ²Ð°ÑÐ° ÑÐµÐ»ÐµÐ¹</a>","zh":"<a href=\"showinfo:3427\">ECMç®æ å¹²æ°å¨</a>æä½³å°ç¨åå¤±åèå´å æ"},"importance":2,"unitID":105},{"bonus":25,"bonusText":{"de":"Bonus auf die Reichweite von <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM-Pulsgeneratoren</a>","en":"bonus to <a href=showinfo:3427>ECM Burst</a> range","fr":"de bonus Ã  la portÃ©e des <a href=showinfo:3427>salves CME</a>","ja":"<a href=showinfo:3427>ECMãã¼ã¹ã</a>ã®ç¯å²ãæ¡å¤§","ru":"ÑÐ²ÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð°ÐµÑÑÑ Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð¼Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑÑ Ð´ÐµÐ¹ÑÑÐ²Ð¸Ñ <a href=showinfo:3427>Ð³ÐµÐ½ÐµÑÐ°ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð² Ð¸Ð¼Ð¿ÑÐ»ÑÑÐ½ÑÑ Ð¿Ð¾Ð¼ÐµÑ</a>","zh":"<a href=\"showinfo:3427\">ECMèå²æ³¢</a>èå´å æ"},"importance":3,"unitID":105}]}},500001,{"0":[96,100,165,138,139,85],"1":[96,100,165,138,139,85],"2":[96,100,165,138,139,85],"3":[96,100,165,138,139,85],"4":[96,100,165,138,139,85,118]},0],

Internal systems are supplemented with multiple redundancies. <br>\r\nThe nature of rogue drones makes it difficult to determine if these improvements are the result of conscious effort or, as some engineers theorize, a sort of natural selection after years of losing traditional bunkers to capsuleer raids.<br>\r\n<i>Senior Defense Analyst Jervei, FIO.</i><br><i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination.</i>",100000,100000000,10000,1,null,0,550,null,100000000,2583,null,null,null,null,0],

A chief aim of this project is to understand the causes and mechanics driving such incredible destruction. \r\n\r\nThis project has compiled all the known data on the subject, including multiple expeditions to âshattered planetâ systems (located across both New Eden and wormhole space). We expect to uncover significant details about the mechanics of wormhole initiation as well as the role and power of Isogen-5, which is implicated in the events of that day.\r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek'Jaalan Project.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system (beacon designation - <b>AJS1: Antiquus</b>).<i>",1,0.1,0,1,4,0,null,null,0.1,null,null,null,null,null,0],

The rogue drone hive found at the Skeleton Comet complex within the <a href=showinfo:5//30002681>Deltole</a> system appears to have assimilated ancient technologies left behind by the Yan Jung nation, resulting in the development of a new strain of drones, potentially more powerful than their standard counterparts. \r\n\r\nTwo reports on these events were gathered to determine the extent to which the drones were affected by assimilating the Yan Jung technology, and to establish what level of threat this could pose. The findings showed that the new strain of drones possess significantly enhanced communication systems and cognitive abilities as compared with their predecessors. However, through the examination process it was also discovered that apparently, nearly all of the new drone strains had been destroyed by the original rogue drone hive, likely due to self-regulatory mechanisms within the hive.

This brings up the question of how life originally came to planets in Anoikis.\r\n\r\nThe âmolecular clockâ method was used to estimate how long ago life in Anoikis and life in known space had a common ancestor. In the molecular clock method random changes to segments of âjunkâ DNA are examined and compared between organisms.

Apparently, during this time, some space-faring civilization survived, or arose much faster than has been assumed. This civilization appears to have moved to Anoikis and made use of the planets.\r\n\r\nSome organisms were found that had a common ancestor with life in known space about a year ago.

The most interesting one is a certain fungus found on several temperate worlds.\r\n\r\nThis fungus appears able to colonize almost any surface or other organism. As it digests another organism, some proteins from that organism are displayed on the surface of the fungal strands. This allows the fungus to evade the immune system of many infected hosts.\r\n\r\nSome bacteria were also found that appear to be somewhat infectious. They do not appear to be too virulent, but some of the chemicals they produce are of particular interest. These chemicals have neurological effects that alter the behavior of the host, helping spread the bacteria.\r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>",1,0.1,0,1,4,0,null,null,0.1,null,null,null,null,null,0],
"4338":["The Arek'Jaalan Project was founded to act as a cross-organizational research body and common ground for capsuleers to share information about the Sleeper civilization and related matters. The goals of the project are, relative to similar bodies, both simple to understand and quite humble. Put simply, our aim is to research, document and educate.\r\n\r\n<b>Research:</b> We aim to posit and debate theories, study known facts and uncover new ones, and use every other method available to deepen our understanding of the Sleepers and related subjects.\r\n\r\n<b>Document:</b> Through extensive use of open networks, and with the help of key staff, we aim to document all of the information shared between project members, from everyday communication to large-scale research projects.\r\n\r\n<b>Educate:</b> Using our body of contributors and their documented research as a foundation, we aim to educate other capsuleers about our work, and to encourage wider capsuleer interest in scientific matters by presenting information openly and accessibly.\r\n\r\nIn its initial phase, the project aims to build a âfoundationalâ body of documented research, at which point a larger focus will begin to be placed on the goal of education.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that Arek'Jaalan does not aim to produce new technologies, and in particular that we take an active stance against any further weaponization of Sleeper or other technologies. We aim for something more benign and progressive.\r\n\r\nIt should be similarly noted that much of our work lies in centralizing and documenting scattered, yet publicly available, information. In the absence of these hard facts, we turn to educated theory. Although there is always the risk of information being used for immoral ends, it should be remembered what the majority of our work at the Arek'Jaalan project actually amounts to, and that our own stance is to be firmly against such actions.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly, the current focus of interest in capsuleer research is applied science, particularly weaponization. The work we do is intended to help humanity, and science as a whole, not just the capsuleer military-industrial cycle. Arek'Jaalan stands apart from the destructive mainstream; as an alternative way for capsuleers to use their unique capabilities. ",1,0.1,0,1,4,0,null,null,0.1,null,null,null,null,null,0],
