Unique subsystems and fittings, coupled with a new compact ice mining laser design, give the Endurance the unique ability to harvest ice from a frigate class hull. In addition to this, the creators of the Endurance managed to retain much of the stealth technology that Expedition frigates have become known

It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.\r\n\r\nFrom this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.\r\n",1310000000,18135000,2175,1,4,1700000000,3000,20062,18135000,21252,null,{"miscBonuses":[],"roleBonuses":[{"bonusText":{"de":"Es kÃ¶nnen <a href=showinfo:27951>Triage-Module</a>
