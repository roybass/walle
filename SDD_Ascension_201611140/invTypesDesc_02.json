It is the burial place of the long-dead Nefantar prophet, Tyrion Plethar, the first Minmatar priest of the Amarrian religion, as well as hundreds of other priests and saints.  It so happens that this holy site is located inside a giant space ship, still intact despite many years of neglect, and incredibly the crew was found still alive, albeit in a cryogenic state.  <br><br>  Originally this holy site was located in Hjoramold XII which now resides in Minmatar Republic space.  During the great Rebellion, the Nefantar government on the planet had given up all hope of defending their solar system against the massive rebel forces headed their way.  The neighboring constellations had already fallen and it was only a matter of time before their own fell into the hands of their enemies.  So they decided upon a drastic plan to save the holiest site located within Nefantar space, the burial place of Tyrion Plethar.  <br><br>  The plan was to transfer as much of the holy site, buildings and all, into a giant space ship, renamed to the âPletharian', which would in turn fly towards the Amarr Empire, where it would most assuredly be kept safe.  The ship had originally been built by Amarrian engineers to be a mobile outpost of sorts, but was the only available vessel that could carry the massive buildings which were part of the burial site.  <br><br>  Loading the burial site onto the ship took a matter of days, although it was quite a hasty procedure and resulted in a number of mishaps, where a number of the buildings were damaged and one even completely destroyed as it toppled from the cranes used to elevate it from the ground.   But eventually the majority of the buildings had been painstakingly transferred into the space ship.  It was then that the rebels attacked, appearing out of nowhere and quickly descended upon the meager Nefantar defenses,.  <br><br>  But even though the defenders were no match for the incoming Minmatar armada, they still bought the Pletharian enough time to set off on its course towards Amarr Space.  The only problem was, it was too massive to use the stargate.  It had been brought to the system in parts and assembled, but in its current state there was no way it could access the stargate out of Hjoramold.   So they had to manually fly it through the vastness of space, without any jump-drive capability.  <br><br>  The destination was Audesder, a solar-system heavily fortified with Amarr forces.  At the time the Nefantar government in Hjormold believed that it was impossible for the rebels to advance far enough to conquer Audesder.  Ironically this system was one of the last to be taken during the later stages of the rebellion.",1,0.1,0,1,null,0,null,null,0.1,null,null,null,null,null,0],
"23891":["Little is known of what happened to the Pletharian during its journey, and eventually the remaining Nefantars, now called Ammatars, gave up hope of ever finding it again.  But with its discovery by Minmatar explorers,  the situation has changed dramatically.  The Republic has released little info on their findings to the public, but one thing is clear, something must have caused the Pletharian to malfunction and become stranded in space for all these years.  Possibly a collision with an asteroid, or simply a breakdown of their thruster system.  Whatever the cause, the Pletharian has now become the hottest topic on everyone's lips within the Ammatar / Minmatar border zone.  <br><br>  Needless to say, shortly after the discovery had been confirmed by Republic authorities, the Ammatar government demanded that it be handed over to them.  The Republic refused, citing that it contains the remains of convicted mass-murderers and Amarrian collaborators, and it would be an affront to all those enslaved and tortured during Amarrian rule to hand them over to the Ammatar.  Instead they intend to make it into a museum, to be shown to Republic citizens as a grim reminder of the past.  <br><br>  The Ammatars were far from pleased.  This was the last straw in a chain of political collisions between their people and the Republic.  Their citizens demanded action, and even within the Amarr empire itself there were rumors that the imperial fleet was preparing for war.  After all, Tyrion Plethar was the most highly regarded member of the Amarr faith which was of Minmatar origin.  The Republic's refusal to hand over his remains was not only an affront to the Ammatar nation, but to the Amarrian church as well.  <br><br>  And so the buildup for war has begun.  The Amarr and Ammatars have built a massive military outpost in Kenobanala, which is directly connected to Audesder.  Cruisers and battleships keep arriving daily from all over the empire, and media reports indicate that even Minas Iksan, one of the Empire's most prestigious military generals, who led the successful campaign against the Blood Raiders a few years ago, has arrived.  This does not bode well for the stability of the region, which is already on the brink of a potentially disastrous war.  <br><br>  To top it all off, the Caldari and Khanid, which have recently become official allies of the Amarr Empire and Ammatar, have been caught up in the fray.

The Gallente Federation and ORE have lent their support as well, the Federation sending an armada of ships to help defend Audesder incase of an attack, and ORE supplying the Minmatar forces with financial aid as well as hired mercenaries.  <br><br>  War looms over this troubled area, and analysts suspect that it may spread to outlying regions.  This could even be the start of a new galactic war that no one wants except the most fanatical nationalists.  CONCORD are monitoring the situation closely, and have reportedly been trying their hardest to soothe the political climate to prevent an all-out-war.

"23945":["But soon the old man became suspicious.  He couldn't believe the incredibly good fortune his son was suddenly blessed with was simply due to hard, honest work.  So he hired an expensive private detective, Asamura, to investigate the internal affairs within Komni, to better understand exactly what had changed since disaster loomed over the corporation.  Asamura, being an ex-elite agent within the Caldari State special forces, quickly discovered who was behind this turn of events; that the Guristas had been using the garbage haulers as a means to smuggle drugs and other illegal goods into Caldari high security space for enormous profits.  Due to Kaimos's close relationship with many members of the Caldari State government, the garbage haulers received far less attention from local security forces than other, more suspcious craft.<br><br>When Kaimo heard of these tidings he became furious. If the news surfaced about Komni being under the influence of the Guristas Pirates and committing illegal acts within the Caldari State borders, his status and even his life might be forfeit.  He immediately confronted his son and ordered him to cut all ties with the Guristas, as well as letting him know that he had just blown any chance he had of acquiring the family fortune.  But there was one single flaw in Kaimos plan, and that was his underestimating of his sons determination to remain wealthy.  Threatening to expose Komnis illegal dealings to the media, Shojin played the only card he had.  Either his father leave his corporation alone and give it a large credit \"donation\", or both of their reputations would be ruined.  In return Shojin would severe all ties with the Guristas.  His father reluctantly accepted his sons terms.<br><br>Shortly thereafter Shojin held a secret meeting with his contact within the Guristas.  He demanded that Drako stop the illegal activity the Guristas had been conducting behind his back, and remove all ties they had with Komni.  But the wry, finely dressed agent simply laughed, they had played Shojin for a fool all along.  While Shojin had been endulging himself with the finer things in life, Drako had been busily hoarding the company stocks in preparation for a takeover.  He knew about Asamuras involvement, and expected this very conversation.  As Shojin looked in horror, two burly, brown-skinned men entered the room where he stood next to Drako.  With a simple move of his right hand, Drako ordered his guards to execute his unfortunate client.  And as he left the room, followed by high-pitched screams which were quickly silenced, the smiling, middle-aged man dressed in a shiny black tuxedo thought of how happy he was that the Komni stock had risen drastically upon the news of the takeover.  No longer would he need to answer to his less-than-trustworthy superiors within the Guristas, from this day forward he would own his very own branch within the vast Caldari criminal network.  \n\n",1,1,0,1,null,0,null,null,1,null,null,null,null,null,0],

After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency.

Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process. \r\n\r\nResearch interest picked back up in Gas Harvesting technology when new, stable wormholes began proliferating across the cluster. As soon as the wormholes were discovered, so too, were the giant gas cloud pockets within the unknown systems they linked to. In a single day, the demand for Tech II Gas Cloud Harvester exploded. Research projects were hastily established and grants hurriedly thrown out to the most promising firms pursuing a redesign. It was only a few days before a breakthrough was made, and all the harvesting technology that had come before was quickly relegated to second place.
