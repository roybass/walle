The Palatine Keepstar is being offered under terms of a highly encrypted construction template that will limit the number that can be built and operated at any given time.\r\n\r\nLike the standard Keepstar, the Palatine Keepstar has been built with new spaceship tethering technology as standard, and it will accommodate all size classes of ship, including 'supercapital' vessels, in its internal docking bays. The defensive capabilities of the Palatine Keepstar are formidable and are highly enhanced in lower security star systems with the ability to mount area effect and 'doomsday' weapons. The Palatine Keepstar can be configured using Upwell's Standup brand service and structure modules so as to serve the specific needs of the structure operator. Further adjustment of the hardware of the Palatine Keepstar can be achieved by installed Standup XL-Set rigs to optimize the specific role of the citadel.\r\n\r\n25% bonus to all structure combat rig effects\r\n25% reduction in citadel service module fuel consumption\r\nOnly one Upwell Palatine Keepstar may be deployed at any time in New Eden",50000000000,800000,0,1,8,0,150000,20233,800000,21315,null,null,null,null,0],

It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.

Despite its excessive weight and extended recharge time, the âForge Gunâ as it has become known, is regarded as the most devastating infantry weapon on the battlefield, and an invaluable tool for those capable of wielding it.\n\nPowered by a Gemini microcapacitor, the forge gun utilizes a stored electric charge to fire kinetic slugs at speeds in excess of 7,000 m/s, enough to penetrate even augmented armor systems. During the pre-fire charge, the forward armature locks into position, stabilizing the magnetic field and helping to shield the user from backscatter and the excessive heat produced.  Power generation remains the single largest drawback of the current design, the onboard capacitor requiring a significant amount of time to reach full power after each discharge.

Built using a repurposed heavy frame, the suit is designed for maximum offensive flexibility. The streamlined frame does away with extraneous armor layers, using the augmented power of the exoskeleton to instead shoulder the weight and bulk of two light-class weapons.\r\n\r\nInterlaced with subframe wiring, the Amarr variant utilizes asymmetric power distribution to intelligently reroute power to the suitâs various subsystems as needed. This improved throughput allows light-class laser weaponry to draw from the suitâs power reserves to enhance the damage dealt.\r\n\r\nThe Commando is the ultimate suppression fighter.
